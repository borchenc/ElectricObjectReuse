# ElectricObjectReuse
Leveraging Electric Object's website display (https://www.electricobjects.com/set_url) we can get it to display our own custom web page. Add in using GitHub's Pages (thanks GitHub), Unsplash direct URL queries (thanks Unsplash), and Freedom Forum's daily cover updates (thanks Freedom Forum), we can make a free randomized picture frame with NYTimes over it.

I could have made this more fancy, but this gets the job done, and refreshes every two hours.
